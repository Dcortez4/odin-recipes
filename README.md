# odin-recipes

BEFORE THE PROJECT:                                     Jul 13th, 2024
The project odin-recipes is an html website that will have multiple links to cooking recipes that looked good to me and make me want to try it. It will have a main index page which then will redirect the user to the recipe. Eventually, the website will be more pretty and styled but for now it is just a basic ol website.
