ODIN RECIPES WEBSTIE 

This website's main purpose is to display recipes found online to practice html elements like headings, images, lists, and links. Eventually the appearance of the website will be changed using CSS skills learned from The Odin Project.

After finishing the html portion of the project, I feel like using the elements wasn't too difficult, but I would get distracted with how the sloppy the website was looking. I had began to use <br> to try and make the text in unison but had read online that's what CSS, which is why I ended up taking longer on doing the project. Overall, wasn't too bad and excited for the rest of the project.

The project odin-recipes is an html website that will have multiple links to cooking recipes that looked good to me and make me want to try it. It will have a main index page which then will redirect the user to the recipe. Eventually, the website will be more pretty and styled but for now it is just a basic ol website.
