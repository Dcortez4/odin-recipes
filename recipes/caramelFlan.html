        <!--Description about the food-->
        <p>Flan is a luscioulsy creamy and decadent desert with a rich custard
            base topped with a layer of caramelized sugar. It's known for its smooth
            texture, velvety consistency, and perfect sweetness. Flan is typically
            made from simple ingredients like eggs, milk, sugar, and vanilla, but it
            can be made even better with an addition like cream cheese.
        </p>
        <p>Flan is baked in a water bath, which involves placing the baking dish containing
            the flan custard inside a larger pan filled with hot water. This helps ensure
            even cooking and prevents the custard from curdling or overcooking. This is an 
            essential step to making the creamiest flan.

        <!--Steps to make recipe (Ordered list)-->
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees.</li>
            <li>In a heavy-bottomed pot, add 1 cup of sugar, and cook on medium-low heat until 
                sugar is completely melted and a deep golden brown. Pick up the pan and swirl
                it around to ensure the sugar is evenly melted.</li>
            <li>Once the sugar is melted, immediately pour into a 9-inch cake plate, pie plate,
                 or flan pan. Swirl around until evenly coated. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl or blender, combine the filling ingredients. Whip until 
                creamy. Pour into the baking pan.</li>
            <li>Place the pan on a larger baking sheet or roasting pan. Place in oven and 
                carefully add hot water to reach at least 1-2 inches on the sides.</li>
            <li>Bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour. Carefully remove flan from oven, leaving behind 
                larger pan filled water. Once flan is removed, carefully remove the pan of hot
                 water. Place flan back inside roasting pan, filled with water, to slowly cool 
                 for 30 minutes. </li>
            <li>Place flan in the refrigerator to chill for at least two hours, overnight is 
                ideal.</li>
            <li>When ready to serve, take a knife and run along sides of the pan.  Take a cake
                 plate or serving platter and place it on top of the pan. Flip it over and the 
                 flan with release so the caramel is now on the top. The caramel will slowly 
                 drip off of the pan so make sure you get all of the caramel.</li>
            <li>Serve with fresh whipped cream and strawberries.</li>
        </ol>
